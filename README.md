# Flecto: Frontend Exercise

Welcome!
Following our previous conversation, we’d like to invite you to our technical challenge where you can showcase all your talents. We know this we’ll be a walk-in-the-park and respect your schedule so rest assured that it won’t take too much of your spare time.

## **Overview**

The main goal of this exercise is for you to do a single page showing a paginated list (either as a table, list, or cards) of weird-named planets from Star Wars. You’ll consume a simple API from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/documentation#intro) which you’ll then treat and show.

Feel free to use any components’ library and any Jedi mind tricks you like.

Let's go!

## **Task requirements**
The main requirements are:
- The user should be able to search for planets;
- The user should be able to paginate the list of planets;
- The user should be able to see details about the selected planet.
