# Flecto: Frontend Exercise

Welcome!

We are more than happy to know you want to join our team. We’d like to invite you to our technical challenge where you can showcase all your talents.

We know this we’ll be a walk-in-the-park and respect your schedule so rest assured that it won’t take too much of your spare time.

## **Overview**

The main goal of this exercise is for you to do a single page showing a paginated list (either as a table, list or cards) of weird-named planets from Star Wars. You’ll consume a simple API from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/documentation#intro) which you’ll then treat and show.

Feel free to use any components’ library and any Jedi mind tricks you like.

Let's go!

## **Task requirements**

The main requirements are:

- The user should be able to search for planets;
- The user should be able to paginate;
- The user should be able to see details about the selected planet.
